# LaTex Templates

I recently (at the time of writing this) started taking my Math, Physics and most importantly my CS notes
in LaTex. Mainly because of my wrist condition, I wanted to avoid writing as much as possible while also
compensating for my handwriting.

## Copying the templates

Depending on the system command line is the easiest way to go about this.

```Output
cp template/* {location}
```

```Output
mv template.tex {filename}.tex
```
